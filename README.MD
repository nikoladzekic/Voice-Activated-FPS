## Voice Activated Multiplayer First Person Shooter game ##


The game is not fully polished, there might be some bugs, but overall functionality is working as expected.


The idea of the game was to create first-person shooter with elements of parkour, similar to Titanfall 2, but the weapons get displayed in players hand, instead of classic pick up system.

## SETUP ##

To play the game you need to open both projects inside Unity, UnityGameServer is a multiplayer server built from scratch, that acts like a real game server, once it gets booted up players may join the lobby, otherwise players are not able to join.

Open the UnityGameServer project and start the project by pressing the play button. The Server will be hosted on port 26950, if something in your setup is already on that port, make sure it is free before starting the project. 

Once the server is started(the play button inside UnityGameServer project became blue), you can open up second project inside folder Game. If you wish to run multiple instances, you can do so bu runing project from Build. If you wish to play with friends, you need to port forward your router, and change the IP Address to your own inside configurations inside Game project.

## GAMEPLAY ##

To move use keys WSAD, to jump press SPACE, to double jump press SPACE again, to crouch press CTRL, to slide press SHIFT while running, to wall slide hold directional key according to the side of the wall you are sliding off(ex. if you want to slide off the wall on left, hold D, on the right hold A).

To get the gun you need microphone, it is best to use headphones for the thrill of the experience. 

There are 3 guns right now, AK-47, M4, and Desert Eagle.

To get AK-47 say AK.

To get M4 say M4.

To get Desert Eagle say GUN.

Now you can shoot, reload and infinetly fight with your friends for the ultimate Alpha Male position.
